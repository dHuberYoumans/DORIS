# DORIS

**Work in progress**

This project aims to develop a maneuver detection algorithm for the satellite cluster DORIS.

The data is freely available from the CDDIS DORIS data center.

Python scripts are provided to download data for various satellites, time frames, and analysis centers, as well as to download the schedule of maneuvers. The actual detection algorithm is being developed in a Jupyter notebook. This notebook guides the reader through the author's thought process and decision-making. As this is a work in progress, ideas, comments, and suggestions are welcome and appreciated.
